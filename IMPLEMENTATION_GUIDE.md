✅ 5+ beta users using daily
✅ Positive feedback on core value
✅ 70%+ prediction accuracy

**Week 4:**
✅ Product Hunt launch
✅ 50+ signups
✅ 1-5 paying customers

## Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue: No predictions showing**
Solution: Run data collection manually, wait 5 minutes, refresh

**Issue: Backend crashes**
Solution: Check Railway logs, verify all env vars set, restart

**Issue: Frontend can't connect**
Solution: Check NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL is correct, test backend directly

**Issue: Reddit rate limit errors**
Solution: Collection has 1.1s delay built-in, should not happen. If it does, increase delay in reddit_service.py

**Issue: Low accuracy**
Solution: Collect more data (48+ hours), adjust weights in prediction_service.py
